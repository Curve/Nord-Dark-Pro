## ✒️ Note

This theme was made with emphasis on C++, the colors for other languages are generated automatically over the base of `One Dark Pro`.

The [base theme file](themes/Nord-Dark-Pro.json) is extremely short & simple and will only work properly in C++ Projects, so if you wish to modify it you can easily do so.

If you're done editing the theme you should compile & execute the theme `joiner`.  
There may be conflicts when merging the two themes, you can resolve them yourself in the terminal.  

The current `Full-Theme` has the following conflicts resolved with:
- `#abb2bf` with `#81A1C1`
- `#c678dd` with `#8FBCBB`
- `#e5c07b` with `#6E8DB4`
